Quick update on the recent experiments:

Table Summaries vs. Hypothetical Questions

Summaries of tables (now designated as “table” in unstructured.io) are performing well for Mark’s questions.
The hypothetical questions approach also works, but for Mark’s high-level queries, straightforward table summaries are sufficient.
Image Resolution Matters

Lower resolutions (e.g., 512×512) failed to capture large tables accurately, leading to incorrect answers.
At 1024×1024, the same tables produced correct results.
Plan to explore a dynamic scale factor (e.g., smaller images at 256/512 for small figures, 1024 for larger tables) to optimize clarity versus token cost.
Next steps:

Putting together slides to highlight these two findings (table partitioning vs. hypothetical questions, and 512 vs. 1024 resolution).
Will link to detailed documentation so everyone can dive deeper into the work and results
