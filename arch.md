# Chat Follow-Up Functionality Design

## Functional Design

### Core Components

- **Session Management**:
  - Generate and maintain a unique session ID for each user session.
  - Store session metadata (e.g., timestamps, chat history) to correlate queries and responses.

- **Chat History Management**:
  - Store user queries, responses, and context in a scalable database (e.g., MySQL or Cosmos DB).
  - Allow efficient retrieval of recent and relevant chat history using indexing and filters.

- **Context Augmentation**:
  - Combine historical data with the current query to build contextual responses.
  - Use embeddings to rank or filter the most relevant parts of chat history.

- **Agent Orchestration**:
  - Ensure that all microservices (agents) accessing the chat history operate seamlessly, sharing a unified context.

- **Follow-Up Handling**:
  - Process follow-up queries by understanding implicit references (e.g., pronouns, omitted context).
  - Utilize LLM capabilities to infer relationships between the current query and historical interactions.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Architectural Layers

- **Frontend**:
  - Enable user interactions through a chat UI with context awareness.
  - Provide options for users to clear or reset context.

- **API Layer**:
  - Provide endpoints for storing, retrieving, and clearing chat history.
  - Support interaction with LLMs, embedding services, and databases.

- **Backend Services**:
  - Handle chat persistence, session management, and query augmentation.
  - Include microservices (e.g., agents) encapsulated in Docker containers.

- **Database Design**:
  - **Primary Store**: Use MySQL for structured chat history, including session IDs, user queries, and responses.
  - **Embedding Store**: Use a vector database or Databricks for storing embeddings to improve relevancy ranking.

- **Orchestration Layer**:
  - Use tools like Kubernetes to deploy and manage microservices for chat processing and history management.
  - Ensure agents can scale independently to handle varied workloads.

## Data Flow

- **Query Processing**:
  - User sends a query through the chat UI.
  - The system assigns or retrieves the session ID and fetches relevant chat history.

- **Contextual Augmentation**:
  - Combine the current query with relevant chat history.
  - Generate embeddings for the current query and retrieve historical embeddings from Databricks.

- **Response Generation**:
  - Pass the augmented query to the LLM for response generation.
  - Include referenced context in the response for transparency.

- **History Update**:
  - Store the new query and response in the database.
  - Update embeddings if necessary.

## Design Construction

### Frontend

- **Chat UI**:
  - Display responses with referenced historical context.
  - Provide options to reset or clear context.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Show user-friendly messages for failures (e.g., "Context not found" or "Session expired").

### Backend

- **Session Manager**:
  - Service to create, validate, and expire session IDs.
  - Ensure session lifecycle consistency across interactions.

- **Chat History Manager**:
  - Provide CRUD operations for chat history in MySQL.
  - Implement efficient indexing for retrieval (e.g., by session ID or timestamp).

- **Context Augmentation Engine**:
  - Fetch relevant historical data and combine it with the current query.
  - Use ranking algorithms based on embeddings to prioritize important context.

- **LLM Integration**:
  - Pass the augmented query to the LLM and retrieve a response.
  - Include context references in the response payload.

- **Embedding Manager**:
  - Generate and store embeddings for queries and responses.
  - Use these embeddings for similarity-based retrieval in follow-up interactions.
