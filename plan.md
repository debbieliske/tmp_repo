1. Search Service Health and Availability
Monitor the overall availability and operational health of your Azure Cognitive Search service.

Service Metrics:

Query Success Rate: Percentage of successful queries (status code 200 responses).
Query Failure Rate: Percentage of failed queries (non-200 responses).
Throttled Queries: Number of queries that were throttled due to resource limits.
Service Availability: Uptime percentage of the search service.
Visualizations:

Pie chart for Query Status Codes (200, 429, 500, etc.).
2. Query Performance
Track how efficiently your RAG application performs searches.

Performance Metrics:

Average Query Latency: Time taken to return search results (ms).
P95 Query Latency: Latency at the 95th percentile for queries.
Query Throughput: Number of queries per second (QPS).
Visualizations:

3. Usage Metrics
Understand user engagement and search behavior in your application.

Usage Metrics:

Total Queries: Total number of queries submitted.
Queries by Filter: Breakdown of queries using specific filters like chunk_id, document_id, or drive_name.
Top Search Terms: Most frequently searched terms.
Queries per Field: Distribution of queries across indexed fields (content, metadata, etc.).
Visualizations:

4. Indexing Pipeline Performance
Track the performance and health of your indexing process.

Indexing Metrics:

Indexer Success Rate: Percentage of successful document indexing runs.
Indexer Failure Rate: Number of indexing failures.
Document Count: Total documents currently indexed.
Documents per Indexer Run: Number of documents processed in each indexing batch.

Counter for Total Indexed Documents.
5. Skillset Execution
Ensure the enrichment pipeline (OCR, text merging, splitting, embedding) is functioning properly.

Skillset Metrics:

Average Skill Execution Time: Time taken by each skill (OcrSkill, SplitSkill, etc.).
Skill Error Count: Number of errors in skill execution.
Skills per Document: Track how many skills are applied to each document.
Visualizations:

Bar chart for Skill Execution Time (broken down by skill).

6. Vector Search
Monitor the usage and performance of vector-based similarity searches.

Vector Search Metrics:

Vector Query Count: Number of vector similarity queries executed.
Vector Query Latency: Average and P95 latency for vector searches.
Embedding Generation Errors: Errors encountered during embedding creation.
Visualizations:

Line chart for Vector Query Count over time.

Counter for Embedding Generation Errors.
7. OpenAI Integration
Track interactions with the Azure OpenAI service for embedding generation.

OpenAI Metrics:

Embedding Requests: Number of requests made to generate embeddings.
Embedding Latency: Time taken to generate embeddings (average, P95).
Token Usage: Total tokens consumed in embedding generation.
Embedding Errors: Errors encountered during embedding requests.
Visualizations:

Line chart for Embedding Requests over time.

Counter for Embedding Errors.
8. Cost Monitoring
Keep track of costs associated with the RAG application.

Cost Metrics:

Search Service Costs: Cost of Azure Cognitive Search usage (queries, indexing).
OpenAI Costs: Cost associated with token usage for embedding generation.
Storage Costs: Cost of Azure Blob Storage for storing documents.
Visualizations:

Line chart for Daily Costs (broken down by Search, OpenAI, and Storage).
Counter for Total Cost to Date.
9. Error Logs and Alerts
Identify and address issues quickly.

Error Metrics:

Query Errors: Log and count of errors in search queries (e.g., invalid syntax).
Indexer Errors: Log of document indexing errors.
Skillset Errors: Errors in OCR, text merging, or embedding generation.
Alerts:

Set up alerts for:
Query Failure Rate > 5%.
Indexer Run Failures.
High Latency (e.g., Query Latency > 500ms).
