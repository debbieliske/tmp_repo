1. Indexer Activity Overview
Visual: Line Chart
Purpose: Monitor indexer activity (e.g., started, completed, failed) over time.

KQL Query:

kql
Copy code
IndexerActivityLogs
| summarize ActivityCount = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m), Status
| order by TimeGenerated asc
TimeGenerated: Timestamp of the log entry.
Status: Indicates the status of indexer activity (e.g., "InProgress", "Completed", "Failed").
Insight: Identify trends in indexing activity and spot irregular patterns.

2. Average Document Processing Duration
Visual: Line Chart
Purpose: Track the average time taken by indexers to process documents.

KQL Query:

kql
Copy code
IndexerActivityLogs
| where ActivityType == "DocumentProcessing"
| summarize AvgProcessingTimeMs = avg(DurationMs) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| order by TimeGenerated asc
ActivityType: Filters document processing activities.
DurationMs: Time taken for processing in milliseconds.
Insight: Monitor indexing performance and identify slowdowns.

3. Indexer Errors and Warnings Over Time
Visual: Stacked Bar Chart
Purpose: Track the volume of errors and warnings generated by indexers over time.

KQL Query:

kql
Copy code
IndexerErrorsWarningsLogs
| summarize Count = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m), Severity
| order by TimeGenerated asc
Severity: Indicates whether the issue is an "Error" or "Warning".
Insight: Pinpoint spikes in errors and understand trends in warnings.

4. Error Details by Indexer Name
Visual: Table
Purpose: List recent errors, their descriptions, and affected indexers.

KQL Query:

kql
Copy code
IndexerErrorsWarningsLogs
| where Severity == "Error"
| project TimeGenerated, IndexerName, ErrorMessage, ErrorType
| order by TimeGenerated desc
IndexerName: Name of the indexer affected.
ErrorMessage: Descriptive text of the error.
ErrorType: Type/category of the error.
Insight: Enable targeted troubleshooting based on error details.

5. Indexer Success vs Failure Rate
Visual: Pie Chart
Purpose: Visualize the ratio of successful vs failed indexing operations.

KQL Query:

kql
Copy code
IndexerActivityLogs
| summarize Count = count() by Status
| order by Count desc
Status: Status of indexer activity (e.g., "Success", "Failure").
Insight: Quickly identify the overall health of indexing processes.

6. Top Indexers by Document Count
Visual: Bar Chart
Purpose: Show the top indexers by the number of documents processed.

KQL Query:

kql
Copy code
IndexerActivityLogs
| where ActivityType == "DocumentProcessing"
| summarize DocumentsProcessed = count() by IndexerName
| order by DocumentsProcessed desc
| top 10 by DocumentsProcessed
IndexerName: Name of the indexer.
DocumentsProcessed: Count of processed documents.
Insight: Identify the most active or overloaded indexers.

7. Retry Attempts by Indexer
Visual: Column Chart
Purpose: Highlight indexers requiring frequent retry attempts.

KQL Query:

kql
Copy code
IndexerActivityLogs
| where RetryCount > 0
| summarize TotalRetries = sum(RetryCount) by IndexerName
| order by TotalRetries desc
RetryCount: Number of retry attempts during indexing.
IndexerName: Name of the indexer.
Insight: Surface problematic indexers that may need optimization.
