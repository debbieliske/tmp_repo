Task Name	User Story	Acceptance Criteria	Purpose	Code Considerations
Store and Retrieve Chat History	As a user, I want the application to remember the context of my previous interactions so that it can provide consistent answers to follow-up questions.	Chat history is stored in the MySQL database as part of the payload (including session ID, user query, and response). The application retrieves relevant chat history during every user interaction.	Preserve chat interactions	"
1. **Database Schema**:
   - Design a MySQL table to store chat history, including fields like session_id, chat_id, user_query, response, and timestamp.
2. **Storage Logic**:
   - Implement a function to save the chat history after every user interaction.
3. **Retrieval Logic**:
   - Develop a function to retrieve the full chat history or relevant parts for a session using session_id.

Maintain Session Context	As a user, I want my session to persist across multiple requests so that the app knows what we have discussed in this conversation.	Each session is assigned a unique session ID that is maintained for the duration of the chat. The session ID is linked to the payload stored in MySQL.	Track active conversations	"
1. **Session ID Generation**:
   - Generate and assign a unique session ID for each user session.
2. **Session Persistence**:
   - Store the session ID on the client side (e.g., using cookies or a token) and send it with every request.
3. **Context Association**:
   - Ensure each interaction is tagged with the correct session ID during storage and retrieval.

Enhance Query Understanding	As a user, I want the application to use my previous questions and responses to better understand my follow-up queries.	The application combines embeddings for the current query with relevant embeddings from chat history stored in Databricks. The embeddings are retrieved and ranked for relevance to construct a meaningful response.	Improve LLM responses	"
1. **Fetch Relevant History**:
   - Use the session ID to retrieve the last `n` queries and responses from MySQL.
2. **Embed Historical Context**:
   - Use Databricks to retrieve embeddings for historical queries and combine them with the current query's embeddings.
3. **Augmented Query Creation**:
   - Concatenate or augment the current query with the historical context for the LLM to process.
        "
Support Multi-Agent Context Sharing	As a user, I want different agents to access shared context so that I can seamlessly interact with various functionalities without losing the chat history.	Each agent retrieves the same shared context (via session ID and chat history from MySQL) before processing a user query. Agents update the chat history after their response is generated.	Enable agent collaboration	"
1. **Shared API**:
   - Develop a REST API that allows agents to fetch and update chat history using the session ID.
2. **Agent Integration**:
   - Ensure each agent container has logic to query the API for context at the beginning of processing.
3. **Payload Updates**:
   - Update the shared chat history payload after the agent completes its task.
        "
Handle Chat History Limits	As a user, I want the application to prioritize recent context if the chat history is too long so that the app remains responsive and relevant.	The chat history retrieval is limited to the most recent `n` interactions or based on a relevancy score. Old or irrelevant entries are archived or ignored during query processing.	Optimize data retrieval	"
1. **Retrieve Limited Context**:
   - Implement logic to fetch only the last `n` interactions from MySQL or filter by relevance (e.g., using embedding similarity).
2. **Archive Old History**:
   - Create a mechanism to archive or prune older history to maintain database performance.
3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Handle scenarios where no relevant history is available gracefully.
        "
Provide User Feedback	As a user, I want to see which part of my previous conversation is being referenced in the follow-up response so that I understand the app’s reasoning.	The response includes a reference to the specific query or context used from the chat history. Users can request to 'clear context' to start a fresh conversation.	Explain reasoning to users	"
1. **Reference Matching**:
   - Track which part of the chat history was used to generate the response.
2. **Response Annotation**:
   - Append metadata to the LLM response indicating the referenced query or context.
3. **Frontend Update**:
   - Modify the frontend to display highlighted references or context summaries alongside the response.
        "
Enable Context Reset	As a user, I want to clear my session's chat history so that I can ask unrelated questions without confusion.	A 'Reset Context' button or command clears the session ID and removes stored context for the current chat.	Allow fresh starts	"
1. **API Endpoint**:
   - Add an endpoint to clear the session’s chat history from MySQL.
2. **Session Reset Logic**:
   - Reset the session ID or clear its association with the chat history.
3. **Frontend Action**:
   - Add a button or command in the UI to trigger the reset process.
        "
Debug and Monitor Chat History	As a developer, I want to monitor chat history storage and retrieval so that I can identify and fix issues quickly.	Logging is implemented for chat history retrieval and updates. Metrics (e.g., retrieval time, storage size) are tracked using Azure Monitor or a similar tool.	Identify and fix issues	"
1. **Logging**:
   - Add logs for chat history read and write operations (e.g., session ID, query, retrieval time).
2. **Monitoring**:
   - Use Azure Monitor or similar tools to collect and display metrics on chat history usage.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Add error-handling mechanisms to log and recover from issues like failed database queries or retrieval timeouts.
